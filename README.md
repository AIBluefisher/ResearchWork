# ResearchWork
My personal research work on Peking University, mainly on 3D reconstruction, includes **Structure from Motion (SfM)**, **Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM)**, **semantic reconstruction**. I'm also interested in numerical optimization, especially **large scale nonlinear optimization**, though only at the begin right now. My dream is to build the world with computer vision technologies. If you are interested in my work, just send me an e-mail. 

## 1. Structure from Motion

### Incremental SfM

### Global SfM

### Hybrid SfM

### Hierarchical SfM

### Viewing Graph

- [x] [[ICCV 2015] Optimizing the Viewing Graph for Structure-from-Motion](http://cs.ucsb.edu/~holl/pubs/Sweeney-2015-ICCV.pdf) **Brief Comment:** This approach has a strong geometric verification by enforcing loop consistency, while not efficiency and may more suitable for global SfM other than other SfM approaches. Besides, the implementation is trivially.
