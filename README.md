# ResearchWork
My personal research work on Peking University, mainly on 3D reconstruction, includes **Structure from Motion (SfM)**, **Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM)**, **semantic reconstruction**. I'm also interested in numerical optimization, especially **large scale nonlinear optimization**, though only at the begin right now. My dream is to build the world with computer vision technologies. If you are interested in my work, just send me an e-mail.

**Brief Comment:** This approach has a strong geometric verification by enforcing loop consistency, while not efficiency and may more suitable for global SfM other than other SfM approaches. Besides, the implementation is trivially.
